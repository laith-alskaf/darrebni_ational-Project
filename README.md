"Darrebni National Project" is a digital resource designed for Syrian students, providing them with a unified platform to study for and confidently prepare for the National Unified Exam. Gone are the days of searching and navigating through multiple sources.

We have addressed several challenges related to studying for the National Exam, including:

Providing a unified study resource.
Collecting previous question banks.
Ensuring the accuracy of answers based on trusted references.
Allowing self-assessment tests to verify acquired knowledge.
Students from various fields such as Information Technology Engineering, Architecture Engineering, Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy can benefit from the "Darrebni National Project" to facilitate their exam preparation and self-assessment. They can also verify the accuracy of answers and information through trusted references available within the application.

The application has been designed with a user-centric approach to provide the best possible study experience.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
